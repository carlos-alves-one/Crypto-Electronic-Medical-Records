# Crypto Electronic Medical Records Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a system to manage and verify Electronic Medical Records (EMR) securely using principles inspired by blockchains, such as proof of work and consensus. It aims to prevent unauthorized access and modifications, ensuring the integrity of patient data.

## Features

### Part 1: Records and Verification
- Implement an EMR class to sign and validate records.
- Utilize cryptographic primitives for secure record management.
- Design a verification system to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

### Part 2: Blocks
- Develop code to validate blocks containing multiple EMRs.
- Implement classes for managing user states and blocks within a blockchain-inspired architecture.

### Part 3: Mining
- Implement a block mining function that produces blocks with valid proof of work.
- Optimize the mining process using parallel processing techniques.
- Explore advanced techniques to improve the efficiency of block mining.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `pyca/cryptography` library for cryptographic operations.
- `multiprocessing` module for parallel processing in mining optimization.

## Implementation Details

### EMR Class
- Create and verify EMR records, ensuring all cryptographic checks pass.

### Block and UserState Classes
- Manage blockchain-like structures to hold and validate EMRs.
- Track user states across blocks for consistency and integrity.

### Mining
- Implement a `mine_block` function to produce blocks with valid proof of work.
- Optimize mining using parallel processing with `multiprocessing` module.
- Distribute mining work among multiple processes to improve efficiency.

## Testing
- Includes comprehensive test cases for validation and error handling.

## Extensions
- Propose and implement enhancements for error checking in address schemes and mining efficiency.

## Setup and Usage
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install `pyca/cryptography` library.
3. Follow the implementation instructions for each part of the project.
